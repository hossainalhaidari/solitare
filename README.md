# Soli

CLI-based Solitare game

## How to Play

- `up`, `left`, `down`, `right`: Navigate through cards
- `p`: Show next card in Pile
- `r`: Resolve highlighted card
- `a`: Auto-resolve visible cards
- `u`: Undo last action
- `space`: Start moving a card
- `s`: Save state
- `l`: Load state
- `n`: Start a new game (when finished)
- `q`: Quit the game

## TODO

- Deal solvable deck (the deck can be impossible to solve as they are generated fully random)
